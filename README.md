Science from data. Not any data, but complex data about human cognition and behavior. 10+ years of statistical coding, ML model development, and empirical study design; diverse data like sensor data, simulations, experiments, observational registry data (RWD), electronic records (EHR), digital application usability studies (UX), discrete choice data, A/B-tests, and web-scraped data. Advanced statistics, machine learning, and AI to forecast human-centered outcomes and behaviors like learning, preference, risky choice, medical choice, perceptions, and health application usage. As such, I am passionate about data.

### My work
* 20+ peer-reviewed publications, the majority first-authored, many a team effort with great collaborators
* 10+ open-source data sets including machine-readable meta-data and semi-automated data documentation
* 3 statistical software libraries, including machine-learning classifiers and automated reporting (R statistics)
* 1 platform for psychometric cognitive testing (Python to interface with Otree)
