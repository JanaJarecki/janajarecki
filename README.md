Science from data. Not any data, but complex data about human cognition and behavior. Ph.D. in Computational Risk Analytics (Modeling Cognition using Machine Learning) and a double degree in Behavioral Economics and Statistical Psychology. Wrote and tested new ML models and R software of human thinking, state-of-the-art risky decision models, and medical real-world insights into digital health application usage. 8+ years of statistical coding and study design experience with diverse data like sensor data, simulations, experiments, observational registry data (RWD), electronic records (EHR), digital application usability studies (UX), discrete choice data, A/B-tests, and web-scraped data, using appropriate statistics, machine learning, and AI to forecast human-centered outcomes and behaviors. Behaviors like learning, preference, risky choice, medical choice, perceptions, and health application usage. As such, I am passionate about data.
